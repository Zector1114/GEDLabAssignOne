---Block Dodger---
A simple game of dodging the falling blocks. If you get hit by one, its game over!

-- What types of objects can your factory create?
My factory creates different kinds of blocks that each function differently from each other.

-- Why is the factory pattern a good choice for spawning these objects?
The factory pattern is good because it doesn't info about or references to the specific objects that its spawning. All it needs is references to the object spawners themselves. So then it tells a spawner to go spawn something with the spawner will do. That means you can freely control which spawners its allowed to have access to in the editor or in the script without changing anything about the actual object spawners themselves.
